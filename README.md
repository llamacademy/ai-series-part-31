# Navmesh AI Tutorial 31 - Showing a Path to a Target Without Using a NavMeshAgent

In this tutorial repository you will learn how to show a path to a specific target without using a NavMeshAgent. 
We'll calculate the path on a NavMesh from the player's current location (controlled via a Third Person Controller) to the target location, and show that with a LineRenderer.
The path calculation has a few knobs to turn, how high above the NavMesh to draw the line and how frequently to recalculate the path.
